            Throughout the history of civilization, we witness an exponential evolution in the abstraction of thought. Abstraction flourishes when fundamental concepts from one field are interpreted and adapted to solve challenges or inspire innovations in others. This conceptual flexibility has consistently driven the advancement of societies, enabling them to think beyond mere survival. One modern example is drawn from the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-01-virtual-slime-mold-subway-network.html" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">study of mycelium networks</a>—intricate fungal systems that naturally optimize resource distribution routes. Inspired by these biological patterns, researchers designed Tokyo&rsquo;s rail system to maximize efficiency and connectivity. Remarkably, they even created a prototype of the city, allowing the mycelium to grow freely and naturally map out the optimal routes!
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            However, this exponential evolution presents a challenge: the widening knowledge gap in our rapidly advancing world. As technology evolves at an unprecedented pace, society is shifting toward a more efficient, robust, and increasingly non-linear world where abstract ideas and concrete technologies converge. The collective intelligence—or &quot;hive mind&quot;—enabled by technology is becoming richer and more intricate.
            Neuroscience and psychology define <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27232162/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">conceptual complexity</a> as &quot;a personality characteristic involving the individual&apos;s ability to differentiate and integrate aspects of information.&quot; In simpler terms, it measures how individuals manipulate ideas, often assessed through linguistic output. Today, in a competitive, innovation-driven environment, conceptual complexity is indispensable. It&rsquo;s not merely a measure of intelligence but a distinct cognitive skill that must be deliberately cultivated. Abstract thinking allows individuals to move beyond immediate, linear tasks to engage with larger, interconnected systems of thought.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Yet, this critical skill is under threat. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes deeply integrated into daily life, its reliance on repetitive structures and predictable patterns risks stifling the creative and abstract processes essential for thriving in an evolving world. This danger is particularly acute for individuals already struggling in educational settings. Without strong foundational skills, over-reliance on AI can hinder cognitive development, limiting the brain&rsquo;s flexibility and deepening socioeconomic divides. Those without access to these cognitive tools risk being left even further behind.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            This idea was inspired by one of my favorite books: Ted Chiang&rsquo;s short story collection <em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em>. One story in particular inspired the movie <em>Arrival</em>, which highlights how humans expand their minds by adopting non-linear frameworks of communication. The story emphasizes how abstract thinking transcends linguistic boundaries, sparking my reflection on the evolution of language and technology&rsquo;s role in this shift toward non-linearity. What do I mean by &quot;non-linearity&quot;? If you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, it centers around a symbol-based language unbound by time. These symbols convey not only semantic meaning but also emotion, history, context, and all the information needed to fully experience the communicator&rsquo;s perspective. Similarly, in our modern world, we see an explosion of symbolic communication—text message abbreviations, emojis, memes, internet culture, open-source collaboration through GitHub, and now AI. Each introduces new symbols and layers of meaning at an exponential rate, reshaping how we think and communicate.
