## PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW  
With a Master of Science in Business Analytics, a Certificate in Machine Learning, and hands-on experience in developing data-driven software solutions, I am eager to contribute to your teamâ€™s mission.  

As a Data Scientist and aspiring Product Manager, I have consistently bridged the gap between strategy, technology, and stakeholder needs, enabling cross-functional teams to deliver impactful solutions. My technical expertise in Python, SQL, and Tableau is complemented by a strong foundation in Agile methodologies, including facilitating scrum ceremonies and aligning project goals with stakeholder requirements. Additionally, I have worked closely with non-technical stakeholders, leading ideation workshops and value identification sessions, and creating graphical deliverables to communicate complex technical concepts. This experience has enhanced decision-making and fostered alignment between business and engineering teams. During my internships at IBM and CTIA-Wireless Association, I applied advanced analytics to support data science initiatives and drive business decision-making within cross-functional teams.
