## **Chatbot Development Using NLP Techniques**  

### **Purpose**  
The primary goal of this project was to develop an intelligent, conversational AI chatbot capable of engaging users in meaningful dialogue. The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and generate human-like responses, facilitating dynamic interactions with users across a variety of topics.

### **Methods**  
- **Data Collection**: The project began with the creation of a custom dataset for training the chatbot. This dataset consisted of over 140 rows of text, each containing a 'context' (the input or query) and a 'response' (the chatbot's reply).  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Used **spaCy** for text preprocessing, which included tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words, to clean and normalize the input data.  
- **Model Selection**: Leveraged **Hugging Face**'s transformer models, specifically GPT-like models, to power the chatbot's ability to generate contextually relevant responses based on the input.  
- **Training & Fine-Tuning**: The model was trained and fine-tuned using the dataset on **Google Colab**, taking advantage of its cloud-based resources to speed up training and improve the model's performance.

### **Models**  
- **Pre-trained Model**: The project utilized pre-trained transformer models from **Hugging Face**, specifically models optimized for conversational AI tasks (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3).
- **Fine-tuning**: The pre-trained models were fine-tuned on the custom dataset to enhance the chatbot’s ability to generate responses specific to the domain of conversation.
- **Evaluation**: The chatbot's performance was evaluated using a set of metrics such as **perplexity**, **BLEU score**, and human evaluation of conversation quality.

### **Outcomes**  
- The chatbot was able to generate contextually relevant and grammatically correct responses for a variety of user inputs.  
- Through fine-tuning, the chatbot exhibited improved performance in maintaining coherent conversations and handling diverse topics.  
- The dataset of 140 rows was expanded over time, incorporating more conversational scenarios and responses, which helped improve the chatbot's versatility.  
- The integration of spaCy for preprocessing and Hugging Face for model deployment resulted in an efficient development pipeline, capable of handling large datasets and complex model architectures.
