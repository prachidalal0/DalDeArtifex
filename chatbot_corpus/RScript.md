### **Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing**  
- Performed statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and ANOVA on multiple datasets to evaluate relationships between variables and identify significant differences.  
- Used R packages like `gmodels`, `multcomp`, `Sleuth3`, `mosaic`, and `knitr` for statistical modeling, multiple comparison tests, data manipulation, and report generation.  
- Conducted two-tailed t-tests, F-tests, and ANOVA to test group differences, supported by post-hoc tests (Tukey, Dunnett) and Bonferroni adjustments.  
- Visualized data distributions and results through plots (e.g., boxplots, density plots) to provide intuitive insights into statistical findings.  

#### **Key Methods & Techniques**  
- **F Distribution**: Utilized `pf()` and `qf()` to compute probabilities and critical values for ANOVA.  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Applied two-tailed t-tests, F-tests, and p-value calculation to test group differences and determine statistical significance.  
- **ANOVA**: Compared means of multiple groups using `aov()`, assessed residuals and deviations from means to evaluate group differences.  
- **Post-Hoc Tests**: Used Tukey’s and Dunnett’s tests, with Bonferroni adjustment, to perform pairwise comparisons after ANOVA.  
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculated 95% confidence intervals for mean differences to assess the range of true population parameters.  
- **Pooled Variance & Standard Error**: Computed to account for differences in sample sizes and variances across groups.  

#### **Example Outcomes**  
- **Diet Restriction and Longevity**: Found a significant difference in longevity between diet groups (N/N85 vs N/R50), with ANOVA and paired t-tests supporting the result.  
- **Investment in Stocks**: Identified significant differences in stock investments across age groups, using ANOVA and post-hoc tests.  
- **Discrimination Against the Handicapped**: Highlighted significant qualification score differences between groups with disabilities, using ANOVA and post-hoc tests (Tukey, Dunnett).  

#### **Significance**  
- Statistical significance was determined through p-values, test statistics (t-ratio, F-statistics), and confidence intervals, with p-values < 0.05 indicating significant differences.  
- Post-hoc tests helped identify specific group differences when ANOVA showed significant results.  
- The analysis framework provided valuable insights into factors influencing outcomes in healthcare, finance, and social sciences.
